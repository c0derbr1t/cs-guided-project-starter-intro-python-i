Basic String Operations
"""

# 1. Strings can be defined as anything between quotes
astring = "Hello world!"
astring2 = 'Hello world!'

# 2. Use double quotes to avoid issues with apostrophes and single quotes
# len counts the characters including punctuation and spaces
astring = "Hello world!"
print("single quotes are ' '")

print(len(astring))

# 3. index prints out 4, because the location of the first occurrence
# of the letter "o" is 4 characters away from the first character.
# this method only recognizes the first.
astring = "Hello world!"
print(astring.index("o"))

# 4. count counts the number of characters
astring = "Hello world!"
print(astring.count("l"))

# 5. slice of the string, starting at index 3, and ending at index 6
astring = "Hello world!"
print(astring[3:7])

# 6. [start:stop:step]
# 2 would be every 2nd item, like 3 & 5
astring = "Hello world!"
print(astring[3:7:2])

# 7. reverse a string
astring = "0123456789"
print(astring[::-1])

# 8. upper and lower
astring = "Hello world!"
print(astring.upper())
print(astring.lower())

# 9. startswith and endswith
astring = "Hello world!"
print(astring.startswith("Hello"))
print(astring.endswith("asdfasdfasdf"))

# 10. split
astring = "Hello world!"
afewwords = astring.split(" ")
print(afewwords)
